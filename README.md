[This page](https://middle-way-approach.github.io/epic-patterns/) creates patterns with a futuristic overlaying planes effect. The patterns can be used as corners, banner or to extract parts of the images for other uses. 
To generate a pattern just hit start until you find a pattern you are happy with and save it using right click. 

The rule 184 is a good starting point. Other interesting patterns are 14, 98, 150. For an overview have a look at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton).
